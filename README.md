# 3DVis dataset
![](3dvisdb.jpg)

## About
3DVis dataset includes a set of 12 heterogeneous scenes for testing 3D scene registration and analysis methods.
Models include homogeneous shapes, repetitive photommetric patterns and symmetries.
Matlab Â© scripts for data handling are included. Scenes are stored in Wavefront .obj format as point clouds with vertex and normals information
